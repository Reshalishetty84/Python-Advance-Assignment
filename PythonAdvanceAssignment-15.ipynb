    "1.What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.8, released in October 2019, introduced several new features and improvements. Some of the notable features added in Python 3.8 include:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Assignment Expressions (the \"walrus operator\"): Introduced the := operator, allowing assignment expressions within other expressions. It allows you to assign and use a value in a single line, improving readability and reducing the need for additional lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Positional-only Parameters: The ability to define function parameters as positional-only, meaning they can only be passed by position and not by keyword. This provides more control over the function's API and allows for clearer parameter usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)f-strings Support = for Debugging: Added the = specifier to f-strings, which allows you to include the variable's name along with its value for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)The math.prod() Function: Introduced the math.prod() function to calculate the product of all elements in an iterable. It provides a convenient way to compute the product without the need for explicit looping or accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "e)SyntaxWarning for Unreachable Code: Added a new SyntaxWarning for unreachable code. This warning helps identify portions of code that are never executed, which can be indicative of programming errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "f)Reversed Dictionary: Provided a new dictionary method dict.reversed() to create a reverse iterator over the dictionary's keys. This allows you to iterate over the dictionary in reverse order based on the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the new features added in Python 3.8. The release also included various performance enhancements, bug fixes, and other improvements. It's worth noting that newer versions of Python, such as Python 3.9 and 3.10, have introduced additional features and improvements beyond Python 3.8."

    "2.What is monkey patching in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of modifying or extending existing code at runtime by adding, replacing, or modifying methods, attributes, or functions of classes or objects, without altering their original source code.The term \"monkey patching\" is derived from the notion of a monkey manipulating or patching code on the fly. It allows you to dynamically modify the behavior of classes or objects without the need to subclass or modify the original code directly.Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Original method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#Monkey patching: Adding a new method to the class\n",
    "\n",
    "def new_method(self):\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"New method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "MyClass.my_method = new_method\n",
    "\n",
    "#Creating an instance of MyClass\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "\n",
    "#Calling the modified method\n",
    "\n",
    "obj.my_method()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a class MyClass with an original my_method. We then define a new function new_method and assign it to MyClass.my_method. This dynamically replaces the original method with the new implementation. When calling obj.my_method(), it executes the new implementation instead of the original method.Monkey patching can be a powerful technique to extend or modify the behavior of existing code, allowing for flexibility and customization. However, it should be used with caution, as it can make code harder to understand and maintain, and conflicts may arise when multiple modules or libraries perform monkey patching on the same code."

    "3.What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow Copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)A shallow copy creates a new object but references the same nested objects as the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Changes made to the nested objects in the copy will affect the original object and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)The top-level object is duplicated, but the nested objects are still shared between the original and the copy.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Deep Copy:\n",

    "a)A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Changes made to the nested objects in the copy will not affect the original object and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Both the top-level object and its nested objects are duplicated entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Deep copy can be performed using the copy.deepcopy() function from the copy module.\n",
    "\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "original = [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "\n",
    "#Shallow copy\n",

    "shallow_copy = copy.copy(original)\n",
    "\n",
    "shallow_copy[1][0] = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "print(original)        # Output: [1, [4, 3]]\n",
    "\n",
    "#Deep copy\n",
    "\n",
    "deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original)\n",
    "\n",
    "deep_copy[1][0] = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(original)        # Output: [1, [4, 3]]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the original list contains a nested list. When we perform a shallow copy using copy.copy(), changes to the nested list in the copy (shallow_copy) also affect the original list. However, when we perform a deep copy using copy.deepcopy(), changes to the nested list in the copy (deep_copy) do not affect the original list.In summary, a shallow copy creates a new object but references the same nested objects, while a deep copy creates a new object and recursively duplicates all nested objects. The choice between using a shallow copy or a deep copy depends on your specific requirements and how you want changes to affect the original and copied objects."

    "4.What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier is not explicitly defined. However, there are practical limits imposed by the Python interpreter and the underlying system.According to the Python language reference, an identifier can be any combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_), with the condition that it must start with a letter or an underscore. There is no specific restriction on the maximum length of an identifier mentioned in the language specification.However, the practical limit of an identifier's length is typically determined by the maximum length of strings supported by the programming environment. For example, in CPython (the reference implementation of Python), the maximum length of a string is determined by the size of the Py_ssize_t type, which is a signed integer type used for indexing and counting objects. The exact size of Py_ssize_t depends on the platform and the version of Python being used.In most scenarios, the length of an identifier is expected to be well within practical limits and should not cause any issues. However, it is generally recommended to keep identifiers concise and meaningful for the sake of code readability and maintainability."

    "5.What is generator comprehension?\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator comprehension, also known as a generator expression, is a compact and memory-efficient way to create a generator object in Python. It is similar to a list comprehension, but instead of creating a list, it generates values on-the-fly as requested, resulting in improved memory usage.The syntax for a generator comprehension is similar to a list comprehension, but uses parentheses instead of square brackets. Here's an example to illustrate the syntax:my_generator = (x for x in range(10))\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the generator comprehension (x for x in range(10)) generates a sequence of values from 0 to 9. It acts as a generator factory, creating a generator object (my_generator) that can be iterated over or used with other iterator functions like next().\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between a generator comprehension and a list comprehension is that a generator comprehension does not create the entire sequence of values upfront. Instead, it lazily generates values as needed, which makes it memory-efficient, particularly when dealing with large or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use generator comprehensions in various situations where you need to generate a sequence of values without the need to store them all in memory at once. They are particularly useful when working with large datasets, processing files, or situations where you want to generate values dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "To iterate over the generated values, you can use a loop, pass the generator object to functions that accept iterators, or use the next() function to fetch values one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "for value in my_generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(value)\n",

    "Using generator comprehensions provides a concise and efficient way to generate values on-the-fly and avoid unnecessary memory consumption associated with storing the entire sequence."
