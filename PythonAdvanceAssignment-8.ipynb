    "2.How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "\n",
    "when a class-based exception is raised, the process of matching the exception to an appropriate exception handler is called exception handling or exception propagation.Exception handling in Python follows the concept of \"exception hierarchy.\" When an exception is raised, Python looks for the closest matching exception handler in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "The current execution scope: Python checks if there is a try statement surrounding the code that raised the exception. If a matching except block is found in the same scope or any enclosing scopes, the exception is handled by that except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-level scopes: If no matching except block is found in the current execution scope, Python moves up the call stack to the higher-level scopes, looking for a matching except block. This process continues until a matching handler is found or until the outermost scope (usually the global scope) is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in Exception class: If no matching handler is found in any of the scopes, Python checks if there is a handler specifically defined for the base Exception class. If such a handler exists, it will be executed.If no handler is found for the raised exception, the program terminates, and a traceback is displayed, indicating the unhandled exception.When matching exceptions, Python considers the exception hierarchy. If a custom exception class is used, it can inherit from the base Exception class or any of its subclasses. This allows for more specific exception handling by catching specific types of exceptions while still being able to catch more general exceptions using the base Exception class.It's important to note that exception handling can also involve the use of else and finally clauses in addition to the try and except blocks. These clauses provide additional control flow and actions to be taken in different scenarios of exception handling."

    "3.Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts are\n",
    "a)Exception Arguments or Attributes:When raising a built-in or custom exception, you can pass additional arguments to the exception constructor to provide context-specific information. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message, context):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "        self.context = context\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    raise CustomException(\"An error occurred\", context=\"Additional context information\")\n",
    "except CustomException as ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(ex.context)  # Access the attached context information\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the CustomException class accepts an additional context argument in its constructor. This context information can be attached to the exception instance as an attribute, allowing you to access it when handling the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Exception Chaining:Exception chaining allows to attach the context of one exception to another exception, preserving the original traceback. This is useful when we catch an exception, perform some additional handling, and then raise a new exception while preserving information about the original exception. We can use the raise ... from ... syntax to chain exceptions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"Invalid value\")\n",
    "except ValueError as ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add additional context and raise a new exception\n",
    "    raise RuntimeError(\"An error occurred\") from ex\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the RuntimeError exception is raised, with the original ValueError exception chained using the from keyword. This allows to access the original exception and its traceback when handling the RuntimeError, providing context about the cause of the error.\n",
    "By attaching context information to exception artifacts, you can enhance the information available during exception handling and gain insights into the circumstances leading to the exception. This can greatly assist in debugging and troubleshooting code issues."

    "4.Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Custom Exception Class:One method is to define a custom exception class and override the __init__ method to accept an error message as an argument. You can then pass this error message to the base class constructor (super().__init__(...)) or assign it to an instance variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    raise CustomException(\"An error occurred\")\n",
    "except CustomException as ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(str(ex))  # Access the error message\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the CustomException class takes the error message as an argument in its constructor and passes it to the base class constructor. The error message can be accessed using the str() function or directly as ex.args[0].\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Formatting String with Exception Arguments:Another method is to use string formatting to specify the error message and include any additional context or variables associated with the exception.This allows you to create dynamic error messages based on the specific circumstances of the exception. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "value = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if value > 100:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid value: {value}. Value must be less than or equal to 100.\")\n",
    "except ValueError as ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(str(ex))  # Access the error message\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a ValueError is raised if the value variable is greater than 100. The error message is specified using an f-string, allowing the value of value to be dynamically included in the error message."

    "5.Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several drawbacks:\n",
    "a)Lack of Specificity: Using string-based exceptions does not provide a clear indication of the specific exception type. It can make it difficult to determine the exact nature of the error and handle it appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Lack of Inheritance: String-based exceptions do not support inheritance, which is an essential feature of class-based exceptions. With class-based exceptions, you can define a hierarchy of exceptions and handle them at different levels based on their specific types.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Limited Functionality: String-based exceptions do not provide the benefits of a full-fledged class-based exception. With class-based exceptions, you can define custom attributes, methods, and additional functionality within the exception class, enabling more robust error handling and customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Reduced Readability: String-based exceptions can make code less readable and maintainable. The use of explicit exception classes provides self-documenting code, making it easier for other developers to understand and work with the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "e)Standardization: Python provides a wide range of built-in exception classes, each designed for specific error scenarios. By using these standardized exception classes or creating custom exception classes, you align with Python's idiomatic exception handling approach and enhance code consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is recommended to use class-based exceptions in modern Python programming. This approach offers greater flexibility, maintainability, and clarity when handling exceptions in the code."
