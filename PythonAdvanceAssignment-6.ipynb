    "1.Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception processing, also known as exception handling, is a mechanism in programming languages that allows to handle and manage exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution.\n",
    "a)Error handling: Exception processing is widely used for error handling scenarios. When an error or exceptional condition occurs during program execution, such as a divide-by-zero error or a file not found error, an exception is raised. By using exception handling, you can catch these exceptions, handle them gracefully, and take appropriate actions. For example, you can display an error message to the user, log the error for debugging purposes, or retry the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Resource management: Exception processing is often employed to manage resources properly, especially in scenarios where resources need to be acquired and released correctly. For instance, when working with files, databases, or network connections, exceptions can occur during the opening, reading, writing, or closing of these resources. Exception handling allows you to ensure that resources are properly released, even in the presence of exceptions. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures efficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Input validation: Exception processing can be used for input validation to handle invalid or unexpected input gracefully. For instance, if your program expects an integer input but receives a string, an exception can be raised. By catching and handling the exception, you can provide appropriate feedback to the user, prompt them for valid input, or take other necessary actions to handle the invalid input. Exception handling enables you to control the flow of the program and ensure that it remains robust and resilient to erroneous input."

    "2.What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't handle or treat an exception in your code, it will propagate up the call stack until it reaches the top-level or global exception handler. The default behavior when an unhandled exception occurs depends on the programming language and the runtime environment in which the code is executed. Here are some common outcomes if an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Program termination: In many programming languages, if an unhandled exception occurs, the program will terminate abruptly. This termination can be accompanied by an error message or a stack trace that provides information about the exception and the location where it occurred. The program's state may not be properly cleaned up, and any remaining tasks or resources may not be handled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Unpredictable behavior: When an exception is not handled, it can lead to unpredictable behavior in the program. It may cause the program to enter an invalid or inconsistent state, resulting in incorrect or unexpected results. This can lead to bugs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Crash or error reporting: In some cases, the runtime environment may catch the unhandled exception and generate an error report or crash dump. This report can provide details about the exception, including the stack trace and other relevant information. This crash report can be helpful for debugging purposes, as it provides insights into the cause of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Resource leaks: If an exception occurs and is not handled properly, it can leave resources, such as open files, network connections, or memory allocations, in an unreleased state. This can lead to resource leaks, where resources are not properly cleaned up and released, resulting in inefficient resource usage and potential system instability."

    "3.What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "\n",
    "The options for recovering from an exception in a script are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Catch and handle the exception: we can use a try-except block to catch and handle specific exceptions. By enclosing the potentially problematic code within a try block, we can specify one or more except blocks to catch specific exceptions and define the appropriate recovery logic. This allows to gracefully handle the exception, take corrective actions, or provide alternate processing paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Retry the operation: If the exception is transient or can be resolved by retrying the operation, we can implement a retry mechanism. This involves encapsulating the operation within a loop and catching the exception. Inside the loop, we can retry the operation a certain number of times with a delay between retries. This approach is useful for scenarios where network connectivity issues or temporary resource unavailability may cause exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Provide default or fallback values: If an exception occurs when accessing external resources or performing calculations, we can set default or fallback values to ensure the script continues execution. This approach allows your script to gracefully handle exceptions by providing alternative values or behavior. For example, if reading a configuration file fails, we can provide default settings to continue with the script's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Log the exception: Even if we cannot recover from an exception directly, we can log the exception details for debugging and analysis purposes. Logging the exception allows you to capture relevant information such as the exception type, stack trace, and contextual data. This information can assist in diagnosing and resolving the issue later.\n",
    "\n",
    "e)Graceful termination: In some cases, the best option may be to gracefully terminate the script if the exception represents a severe or unrecoverable error. we can use the sys.exit() function or raise a new exception to stop the script's execution and provide an appropriate error message."

    "4.Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two methods for triggering exceptions are:\n",
    "a)Raise an exception explicitly: We can raise an exception manually using the raise statement. This allows to generate an exception of a specific type with a custom message.Example:raise ValueError(\"Invalid input value.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Call a function or method that raises an exception: Many built-in functions and methods in Python can raise exceptions based on certain conditions. By calling these functions or methods, we can trigger exceptions in the script. For example, the open() function in Python raises a FileNotFoundError if it cannot find the specified file.Example:\n",
    "file_path = \"test_file.txt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file = open(file_path, \"r\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",

    "    print(f\"File not found: {file_path}\")\n"

    "5.Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "a)The finally block: The finally block is a construct used in conjunction with a try-except block. The code inside the finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It allows to define cleanup code that should always be executed, such as closing files, releasing resources, or performing any necessary cleanup operations.Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "file = None\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    # Perform some operations with the file\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if file:\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "        \n",
    "In this example, the finally block ensures that the file.close() statement is executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This guarantees that the file is properly closed, even if an exception was raised during file operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)The atexit module: The atexit module provides a way to register functions that should be called when the Python interpreter is about to exit, regardless of whether the program finished successfully or an exception occurred. We can use the atexit.register() function to register cleanup functions or other actions that should be performed during termination.Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import atexit\n",
    "\n",
    "def cleanup():\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Perform cleanup operations here\n",
    "    print(\"Cleanup operations executed.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "atexit.register(cleanup)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the cleanup() function is registered using atexit.register(). This ensures that the cleanup() function will be called automatically when the script exits, regardless of the program's flow or any exceptions that may have occurred."
