    "\n",
    "The distinction between greedy and non-greedy matching becomes relevant when there are multiple occurrences of the pattern being matched within the input string.In a greedy match, the quantifier will attempt to consume as much text as possible, potentially spanning multiple occurrences of the pattern. It will match until the last occurrence that allows the overall pattern to match. Greedy matching is the default behavior in regular expressions.On the other hand, in a non-greedy (or lazy) match, the quantifier will attempt to consume as little text as possible, matching until the first occurrence that allows the overall pattern to match.Consider an example where we want to extract text between two delimiters, such as <start> and <end>, in the input string. If the input string contains multiple occurrences of the delimiters, the difference between greedy and non-greedy matching becomes apparent.\n",

(question mark) after the quantifier. This alteration will change the greedy quantifier to a non-greedy one and produce the desired match.In summary, greedy versus non-greedy matching makes a difference when there are multiple occurrences of the pattern in the input string.

Non-tagged groups are used to group patterns together for logical grouping or to apply quantifiers or other operations to a specific part of the pattern without capturing the matched content.In a simple match without any capturing or using matched groups, the practical difference between a tagged and non-tagged group is that a tagged group captures the matched content, which can be accessed or referenced later, while a non-tagged group does not capture the content.Example:\n",

This exclusion means that it is not captured as a separate group, and only the URL part is captured and can be accessed using group().In this scenario, using a non-tagged group has a significant impact on the program outcomes as it improves performance by avoiding capturing overhead for the excluded part and simplifies the result by only capturing the desired URL.Remember that the impact of using non-tagged groups depends on the specific requirements of your program and the pattern you are working with.

    "\n",
    "When parsing a string, the Scanner interface provides several advantages over the re.findall() feature in Python. Here are at least three things that the Scanner interface does for you that re.findall() does not:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Tokenization: The Scanner interface allows you to tokenize a string by defining patterns and extracting individual tokens. It breaks down the input string into smaller, meaningful units (tokens) based on specified patterns. On the other hand, re.findall() focuses on finding all non-overlapping matches of a pattern within a string, but it does not inherently provide tokenization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Iterative Parsing: The Scanner interface enables iterative parsing of a string by providing a convenient way to find and retrieve the next match. It maintains an internal state and allows you to scan through the input string one match at a time. This feature is useful when you need to process the string progressively or perform actions based on each match. In contrast, re.findall() returns a list of all matches at once, without the ability to iterate through them step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Pattern Matching with Actions: The Scanner interface allows you to associate specific actions with patterns. When a pattern is matched, you can define custom actions to be performed, such as executing a function or modifying variables. This gives you more flexibility in how you process the input string. On the other hand, re.findall() primarily focuses on pattern matching and extraction, without built-in support for executing custom actions based on matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Scanner interface provides a more comprehensive and flexible approach to parsing strings by combining tokenization, iterative parsing, and pattern matching with actions. These features make it particularly useful for scenarios where you need fine-grained control over the parsing process or want to perform complex operations beyond simple pattern matching and extraction."
