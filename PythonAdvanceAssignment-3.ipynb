    "1.What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass is a class that cannot be instantiated but instead serves as a template for its subclasses to inherit its properties and methods. To create an abstract superclass in Python, we use the 'abc' module that provides the 'ABC' (Abstract Base Class) class.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_color(self):\n",
    "        return self.color\n",
    "In this example, Shape is an abstract superclass that defines the common properties and behavior for all shapes. The Shape class inherits from the ABC class and contains a constructor that initializes the color property. It also contains an abstract method calculate_area() that will be implemented by all its subclasses to calculate the area of their respective shapes.\n",
    "An example of a subclass that implements the calculate_area() method would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, radius):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Circle is a subclass of Shape that implements the calculate_area() method to calculate the area of a circle.\n",
    "Similarly, other subclasses such as Rectangle, Triangle, etc., can be created that also inherit from the Shape superclass and implement their own implementation of the calculate_area() method.By using an abstract superclass, we can define the common properties and behavior for all shapes, while allowing each subclass to implement its own functionality. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the code and helps to enforce consistency in the behavior of the subclasses."

    "2.What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "a class statement is used to define a new class. The top level of a 'class' statement should contain class-level statements such as class variables, class methods, and so on. If a basic assignment statement is present in the top level of a 'class' statement, it will be executed when the class is defined.Example\n",

    "In this code, the class statement defines a new class MyClass. The top level of the class statement contains three basic assignment statements that set the values of the class variables x, y, and z.When the class statement is executed, the basic assignment statements in the top level are executed in order. In this case, x is assigned the value 1, y is assigned the value 2 (because it is defined as x + 1), and z is assigned the value 3 (because it is defined as x + y).After the class statement is executed, we can access the class variables using the class name followed by the variable name, as shown in the print statements.Output:\n",

    "3.Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when a class inherits from a superclass (i.e., a parent class), it inherits all the methods and attributes of the superclass. However, if the subclass has an __init__ method, it does not automatically call the __init__ method of the superclass. Therefore, the subclass needs to manually call the __init__ method of the superclass using the super() function.\n",
    "The main reason for calling the __init__ method of the superclass in the __init__ method of the subclass is to initialize any attributes or methods defined in the superclass. By calling the __init__ method of the superclass, the subclass can ensure that any inherited attributes or methods are properly initialized before the subclass's own initialization code is executed.Example\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, species):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.species = species\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "        # manually call the superclass's __init__ method\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, species='Dog')\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dog = Dog('Rufus', 'Golden Retriever')\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dog.name)    # output: Rufus\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dog.species) # output: Dog\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dog.breed)   # output: Golden Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Dog is a subclass of Animal. The Animal class has an __init__ method that initializes the name and species attributes. The Dog class also has an __init__ method that initializes the breed attribute. However, the Dog class manually calls the __init__ method of the Animal class using super().__init__(name, species='Dog') to initialize the name and species attributes inherited from the Animal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calling the __init__ method of the superclass in this way, the Dog class can ensure that any inherited attributes are properly initialized before the subclass-specific initialization code is executed. This is why it is important to manually call the superclass's __init__ method in the subclass's __init__ method.\n"

    "4.How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can augment an inherited method by using method overriding, which involves creating a new method in the subclass that has the same name as the method in the superclass.Define a subclass that inherits from the superclass or define a new method in the subclass with the same name as the method you want to augment in the superclass or in the new method, call the original method using the super() function and provide the appropriate arguments.Example\n",
    "\n",
    "class SuperClass:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def some_method(self, arg1, arg2):\n",
    "        # Original implementation\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class SubClass(SuperClass):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def some_method(self, arg1, arg2, arg3):\n",
    "        # New implementation that augments the original method\n",
    "        super().some_method(arg1, arg2)\n",
    "        # Additional code for arg3\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the SubClass inherits from the SuperClass and overrides the some_method method. The new implementation in SubClass calls the original method from SuperClass using super().some_method() and adds additional functionality for the new argument arg3.By using method overriding, you can augment the behavior of the inherited method while still retaining the original functionality."

    "5.How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "classes and functions are both objects that can define a local scope. However, there are some differences between the local scope of a class and that of a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.Class local scope is accessed through the class name or its instance while the function local scope is accessed through the function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.Class local scope is used to define class attributes, while the function local scope is used to define local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.Class local scope is persistent across all instances of the class, while function local scope is created anew each time the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.Class local scope can be used to create class methods and static methods, while function local scope cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class_attribute = 10\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def class_method(cls):\n",

    "def my_function():\n",
    "\n",
    "    local_variable = 30\n",
    "    return local_variable\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, MyClass defines a class attribute class_attribute, a class method class_method(), and a static method static_method(). These methods can access and modify the class local scope using the cls parameter.In contrast, my_function() defines a local variable local_variable that can only be accessed within the function's local scope.Overall, the main difference between the local scope of a class and that of a function in Python is that the former is used to define class attributes and methods, while the latter is used to define local variables."
