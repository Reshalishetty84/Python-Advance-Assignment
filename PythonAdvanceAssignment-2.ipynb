    "Q1.What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Class:The concept of classe, which occurs in many programming languages, is fundamental to object-oriented programming and is easy to understand. Class is used to abstract the common characteristics of different objects, classify objects that are similar to each other into the same concept according to the similarity principle. Class encapsulates data and operations for future reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module:In Python a .py file is considered as a module. After a script file is created, certain functions and variables are defined. You can reuse these functions and variables by importing the module in other files that require these functions or variables. The module name is the file name minus .py suffix.Modules can also be simply divided into built-in modules and custom modules. Built-in modules are built into Python, such as sys, os and other basic modules. Built-in function dir( module_name ) let you see what data the module defines (include variable name, module name, function name, etc.). dir() function will return all currently defined names when no arguments are present."

    "Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python operators work for built-in classes. But the same operator behaves differently with different types. For example, the + operator will perform arithmetic addition on two numbers, merge two lists, or concatenate two strings.\n",
    "This feature in Python that allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context is called operator overloading.Suppose the user has two objects which are the physical representation of a user-defined data type class. The user has to add two objects using the \"+\" operator, and it gives an error. This is because the compiler does not know how to add two objects. So, the user has to define the function for using the operator, and that process is known as \"operator overloading\". The user can overload all the existing operators by they cannot create any new operator. Python provides some special functions, or we can say magic functions for performing operator overloading, which is automatically invoked when it is associated with that operator. Such as, when the user uses the \"+\" operator, the magic function __add__ will automatically invoke in the command where the \"+\" operator will be defined."
